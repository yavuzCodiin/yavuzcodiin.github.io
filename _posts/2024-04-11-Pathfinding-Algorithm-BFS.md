## <u>What is Pathfinding?</u>

<img src="/images/post-1/what_is_pathfinding.jpg" width="1150" height="500" alt="What is Pathfinding?"/>

Pathfinding is the computational process of finding a path between two points. It is a fundamental concept in computer science, used in various fields such as robotics, video games, transportation, and network data flow. The goal of pathfinding algorithms is to find the most efficient route from the starting point to the destination, often while navigating through possible obstacles and adhering to certain rules or constraints.

* For example, in GPS navigation systems used in cars and smartphones. These systems calculate the shortest or fastest route from your current location to your desired destination.

* In robotics, pathfinding algorithms enable autonomous robots to navigate through environments, from simple vacuum cleaning robots that need to cover an entire floor efficiently without retracing their steps, to more complex industrial robots that move materials between different points in a manufacturing plant. 

* In video games, non-player characters (NPCs) must navigate the game world. Algorithms like A* and its variations are commonly used to calculate paths for characters to move from one point to another, ensuring that they can find their way around obstacles and interact with the player and the environment in a realistic manner.


## <u>Common Pathfinding Algorithms</u>

### <u>A* (A-Star) Algorithm</u>
The A* algorithm is one of the most popular and widely used pathfinding algorithms, known for its efficiency and accuracy. It combines features of Dijkstra's Algorithm (which focuses on finding the shortest path) and the Best-First-Search, making it highly effective in a variety of scenarios. A* uses a heuristic to estimate the cost from the current node to the goal, reducing the number of nodes it needs to explore. This makes it particularly suitable for applications where a balance between speed and accuracy is crucial, such as in video games or robotic path planning.

### <u>Dijkstra's Algorithm</u>
Dijkstra's Algorithm is a foundational algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. It works by systematically exploring all possible paths, starting from the initial node, and continuously expanding the closest node until it reaches the destination. While it guarantees the shortest path, it can be slower than A* because it doesn't use a heuristic to guide its search.

### <u>Floyd-Warshall Algorithm</u>
The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a comprehensive algorithm used for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles). It's capable of finding the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes. While not as commonly used in real-time applications due to its computational complexity, it's extremely powerful for pre-calculating paths or analyzing dense networks.

<img src="/images/post-1/floyd_warshall_3.jpg" width="1200" height="350" alt="Floyd Warshall"/>

### <u>Best-First Search</u>
Best-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm used for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at a selected node (often the root in the case of trees, or any arbitrary node for graphs) and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. It's called "Best-First" because it expands the frontier between discovered and undiscovered nodes uniformly across the Best of the frontier.

## <u>General Process</u>

<img src="/images/post-1/general_process.jpg" width="1400" height="850" alt="General Process"/>

## <u>Path Finding</u>
In this project, I started by figuring out how to construct a maze. Once I had a grasp on that, I moved on to understanding the pathfinding algorithm and how it could work within the maze I created. My next step was to think about how to visually represent both the maze and the algorithm's pathfinding process. This is where Pygame came into play. I used Pygame to not only create the maze but also to visualize the algorithm in action. Finally, I wanted to make the whole experience interactive, so I added the ability for users to control the visualization, allowing them to move forwards and backwards through the steps of the algorithm. This approach helped me connect all the different parts of my project, from the maze creation to the algorithm implementation and visualization.

- ### <u>Creating Maze</u>
I tried to give well documented clear code and every function has its docstring but I will also add my comments too this is same for other parts of the project too.
 
```
import copy, random, types
from enum import Enum
```
I first created Cell structure, each cell will have two type, one of them will be `Empty` which our algorithm can move and search through and `Block` for walls of our maze  
```
class CellType(Enum):
    Empty = 1
    Block = 2
```
We have marks on cells so one will be for `Start` and `End` and `No` for rest 
```
class CellMark(Enum):
    No = 0
    Start = 1
    End = 2
```
Here cell is initialized each cell will have these attributes `type`, and `mark` as we defined previously, `position`, `count` for counting steps, `path_from` for storing where it came from
```
class Cell:
    def __init__(self, type = CellType.Empty, pos = None):
        self.type = type
        self.pos = pos
        self.count = 0
        self.path_from = None
        self.mark = CellMark.No
```
A cell network formed by the combination of cell objects
```
class Cell_Network:
    def __init__(self, board):
        self.board = board
```
With `get_size` we get board's height and width.

So this is our maze with `Cell`, `CellMark`, `CellType`, `Cell_Network` we have four classes and they have their attributes so along the way we will use them to create algorithm, finding path and visualizing this let's see how our algorithm works.

### <u>Algorithm</u>

> Greedy BeFS 
> Using a greedy algorithm, expand the first successor of the parent. After a successor is generated:
>1. If the successor's heuristic is better than its parent, the successor is set at the front of the queue (with the parent reinserted directly behind it), and the loop restarts.
>
>2. Else, the successor is inserted into the queue (in a location determined by its heuristic value). The procedure will evaluate the remaining successors (if any) of the parent.

Below you can see how our algorithm works in pseudocode to have more information you can visit [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-first_search#Greedy_BeFS)

```
procedure GBS(start, target) is:
  mark start as visited
  add start to queue
  while queue is not empty do:
    current_node ← vertex of queue with min distance to target
    remove current_node from queue
    foreach neighbor n of current_node do:
      if n not in visited then:
        if n is target:
          return n
        else:
          mark n as visited
          add n to queue
  return failure
```
Our shortest path algorithm requires a board, a start point, an end point, and the maximum distance allowed for the path. It begins by cloning the board, and then it operates on this cloned version. As previously discussed in the context of the cell network, we initialize each cell's count to math.inf. Next, we mark the start and end points on the board. The first position is added to the open list, which we will use to check the cells, setting the start cell's count to 0. We then define our neighbors as [left, right, down, up]. As long as there are cells in the open list, our function continues to operate. It starts by popping the first cell from the list and designating it as the current position. We retrieve the cell at the current position and proceed to check its neighbors. For a neighbor to be considered, it must be a valid point, and its type must be empty. If these conditions are met, we increment the current cell's count by 1 to determine the distance. If this distance is less than the maximum allowed, we assign this distance to the neighbor's count and record the cell it originated from. Finally, we add the neighbor's position to the open list to continue the search process.

While measuring the distance we will use something called Manhattan Distance, it is named after grid shape of streets in Manhattan and in this streets we can't move diagonally so we either move in x or y never both at the same time, so we can't use euclidean distance.

<img src="/images/post-1/manhattan_distance.jpg" width="1150" height="450" alt="Manhattan Distance"/>

This function calculates the distance from start for every cell, not only destination, this is helpful when we think about robots navigation where robot might need to navigate to various points in an environment efficiently. We can use it to calculate the shortest path to any of the nodes. However, if optimization is our priority we'd change the algorithm, when it finds destination it stops.

```

Next I will talk about metrics of board which we will use them to draw our cell, maze, path.

This class will help us to locate specific parts of the board, including the left, top, height, and bottom. Additionally, it will help us to determine cell's x and y coordinates, allowing us to create a cell rectangle.

So I divided my project into three parts and up to here I tried to talk about how I constructed the basic structure of the maze, the shortest path, the backtracking algorithm, and how to visualise the project using them. Now it is time to combine them to create an interactive experience.

## <u>Main Interactive</u>

```
import algo as solver_algo
import my_maze as maze
import draw_s_path as draw

class the_finder(draw.Finder):
    def __init__(self):
        self.reset()

    def step(self, frames):
        """

        This is a function for animating path finding process.

        Parameters:

        Returns:
        --------
          None

        self.max_distance = max(0, self.max_distance + frames)
        self.result = solver_algo.fill_shortest_path(self.wall_maze.board, self.wall_maze.start, self.wall_maze.end, max_distance =self.max_distance)
        self.set_board(self.result)
        path = solver_algo.backtrack_to_start(self.result, self.wall_maze.end)
        self.set_path(path)


    def reset(self):
        """

            The instance of the class from which this method is called. It modifies the `wall_maze`, `max_distance`, and calls the `step` method on itself.

        """
        self.wall_maze = maze.create_wall_maze(30, 22)
        self.max_distance = 30
        self.step(0)
    
menu_text = """Keys:
    Left - Lower maximum distance
    Right - Increase maximum distance
    R - create a new maze
    Esc - Exit
    """

print(menu_text)

finder = the_finder()
finder.run()

```

So here we have two method/function one of them for controlling steps to find shortest path visualization, and other to reset simulation. 

#### Method => step(self, frames)
1. Adjusts `self.max_distance` by adding the number of frames, which represents the maximum distance the pathfinding algorithm can explore in each animation step.

2. `Solver_algo.fill_shortest_path` to compute the shortest path in the maze up to `self.max_distance`.

3. Updates the state of the maze with the result using `self.set_board`.

4. Retrieves the path from the result using `solver_algo.backtrack_to_start` and updates the visual path on the board with `self.set_path`.

#### Method => reset(self)

1. Creates a new maze with walls using `maze.create_wall_maze`

2. Set `self.max_distance`.

3. `self.step(0)` to initialize the maze state for the starting point.
