title: What is WSL?

I am using WSL for development on windows and I believe that it is best possible way to use both windows and linux operating system. Until finding WSL I used full linux or dual boot or through other vm software and for example dual boot was little risky for me because once when I try to install ubuntu and windows together I accidentally erased windows os and that was painful and I needed to find solution. Until something happened to me. Anyway after years later I made dual boot and use it a lot but I created 50 GB from Disk C in my local computer and I don't have much space there since it is SSD and when I run out of space I tried to find solution, and meet with WSL after that I find peace I really liked it, but if you need GUI environment you need some effort or if you are suitable with headless computing you are ok it is fine and another nice feature is you can have different distributions at the same time with different instances for example I have 1 ubuntu 20.04 and 2 22.04 why 2 because I need one of them for special development environment so I have like that. etc. etc.
