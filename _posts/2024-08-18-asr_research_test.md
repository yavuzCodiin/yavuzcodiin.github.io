This is my first time getting into application side of artificial intelligence, I have been researching/learning about machine learning so far it was mostly related with data science and theoretical part, now I had chance to test some real stuff on real hardware and it is exciting. First of all, I tried to understand what is hugging face and when I browse through pages tabs of it I really got excited because there are a lot of stuff that is open sourced and if I have the hardware to test them I had chance to apply them according to my need and this is really powerful, and how lucky we are to live in this era, it is full of oppurtunities

After providing you some sources that I use/d and giving some comparison about Pytorch vs TensorFlow now let's do some local installation and some test, btw I used Jetson Orin NX 8 GB version for my tests. `Up to 70 TOPS, designed for AI and edge applications with a focus on efficiency and low power consumption.`

# <span class="gradient-text_4">How to Use</span>
1. git clone https://github.com/yavuzCodiin/asr_vosk_test.git
2. cd asr_vosk_test
3. python -m venv virtual_env && virtual_env/Scripts/activate
4. cd scripts
5. python asr_vosk.py

# <span class="gradient-text_4">Installation & Test</span>

I had some problems with tensorflow while installing I think version problems mostly and although I used venv I still get them so I decided to use Pytorch

* First I upgraded pip with  
```
    python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
<br>

* Then I also installed transformers with pytorch.
```
pip install 'transformers[torch]'
```

* 
```
pip install requests ffmpeg ffmpeg-python`
pip install pynput sounddevice scipy`
```

<br>

Transformers is an important library developed by 🤗 that provides access to pre-trained transformer models and tools, it is a tool to communication between open source libraries from 🤗

Virtual environment is the safest and clearest one for different version libraries

<br>

## <span class="gradient-text_4">Virtual environment</span>
* First of all check => `python --version` (The venv module is included with Python 3.3 and later)
    * If it is installed navigate to project directory => `mkdir my_project` & `cd my_project`
    <br>
    * Create virtual environment => `python -m venv <virtual environment name>`
<br>
    

* Activate venv with => `.env/Scripts/activate` 
<br>

* Deactivate venv with => `deactivate`

<br>

## <span class="gradient-text_4">ffmpeg installation/configuration</span>
The ffmpeg Python package I installed is not the same as the FFmpeg tool required for processing audio files and on windows I don’t have it .


>The ffmpeg Python package I installed is not the same as the FFmpeg tool required
> for processing audio files. On Windows, I don’t have the FFmpeg tool installed, so I researched a little and find some sources about it 

* [How to install FFmpeg on Windows Step-by-Step Guide](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows)

* [ffmpeg installation](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-release-full.7z)
    * First I installed release build full and extract it under C:\ffmpeg\
    <br>

    * After that I added this files bin to C:\ffmpeg\bin to system variables path part save it then restarted my terminal
    <br>

* When I checked ffmpeg -version with this, I found that it is now installed however another issue came up which is I am working inside virtual environment .env so it is not seen and I need to do something so that .env will see ffmpeg is installed 
    <br>

    * with this you can solve that problem => `$env:Path += ";C:\ffmpeg\bin”`

# <span class="gradient-text_4">Fetch models to use offline </span> 🤗
You can find dozens of libraries in the Open Source ecosystem in 🤗. You can download files in three ways

* By directly downloading them from model page

<div class="image-container" style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/images/post-9/direct_download.png" alt="direct_download" loading="lazy" />
</div>
<br>

* By using [PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained()](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) & [PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained()](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained)

    * Download files with [PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained()](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained):
    
         ```
         from transformers import AutoModelForCTC, AutoProcessor

         model = AutoModelForCTC.from_pretrained("facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h")
         processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h")
         ```
<br>

* Download files by using [huggingface_hub](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/tree/main/src/huggingface_hub) library:

    * Install library
        ```
        python -m pip install huggingface_hub 
        ```

    * By using `hf_hub_download` function I can download a file to specific path:
        ```
        from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download

        hf_hub_download(repo_id="bigscience/T0_3B", filename="config.json", cache_dir="./your/path/bigscience_t0")
        ```
    Once the file is downloaded and stored in the local cache, specify its local path to load and utilize it accordingly.
