(Movie Name: Mars Express) Overall, it was a jam-packed movie. It tried to depict a world where humans and robots coexist, offering various ideas about what such a place could be like. Aside from that, the movie moved quite fast, trying to fit a lot of details into a short time. I generally enjoyed it and would recommend it.
