I believe that maintaining an orderly work environment is crucial for productivity. Therefore, I have been focusing a lot on organizing my personal space. As you can see in the pictures, there has been significant improvement from setup 1 to setup 4. I am very satisfied with my latest arrangement. The current setup offers the widest area I've had so far, and the vertical monitor significantly enhances my workflow. For now, I plan to continue using two monitors, but I intend to switch to three when the time is right. Although I am still using a laptop, I consider it a limitation. The most important aspect of my next setup will be preparing a robust desktop Pc.
