I often wonder why robots have not yet arrived. They are currently limited to industrial or warehouse work. Today, I came across Moravec's Paradox, which explains that what is easy for robots is hard for humans, and what is easy for humans is hard for robots. This paradox suggests that reasoning does not require much computation, but perception skills require a lot of computational resources. The principle was articulated in the 1980s. In 1988, Moravec stated that while it is relatively simple to program computers to perform at an adult level on intelligence tests or games like checkers, it is much more challenging, if not impossible, to give them the perceptual and mobility skills of a one-year-old.
