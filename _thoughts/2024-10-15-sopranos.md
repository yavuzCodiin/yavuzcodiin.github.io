One of the best TV shows of all time. I watched all 6 seasons with great pleasure. After Breaking Bad or Better Call Saul I did not think I would find a show that would be able to keep up the level of quality. But Sopranos did. I love the characters, the story, the acting, the cinematography, the music, the way the episodes are structured. It's just perfect. So I really recommend it to everyone.
