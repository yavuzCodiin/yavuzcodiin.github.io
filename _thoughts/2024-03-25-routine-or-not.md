Only a small proportion of the work that people do is truly routine. Most jobs require problem-solving skills. When faced with new situations or problems, we draw on our past experience and knowledge to find solutions by making analogies. We adapt our approaches as the environment and circumstances change. Social interaction is also crucial in our search for solutions. As a species, we are highly creative and value the input of others. It is important to communicate effectively and consider the opinions of those around us.
