<div style="text-align: center;">
    Man is born soft and flexible, 
    stiff and rigid when they die.
    Plants are born soft and pliable,
    they're brittle and dry when they die.
    So whoever is hard and rigid
    is the disciple of death.
    Whoever is soft and meek
    is the disciple of life.
    The hard and rigid is broken.
    The soft and flexible will prevail.
    -LAO TZU
