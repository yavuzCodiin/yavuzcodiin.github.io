Opportunities come to prepared minds or as I recently discovered lady luck favours those who try (Law of Serendipity), so there is no need to fear what will happen next, fear comes from the unknown, I just need to be ready and work harder each day. Opportunities have always existed and will always exist, and as the access to resources becomes even more possible on an individual level, opportunities will increase even more. The one important thing will be adaptation, I will be left behind if I refuse to adapt new. Struggle will be always there, what I need is not a peaceful existence, but the challenge I am trying to overcome with the skills I have.
