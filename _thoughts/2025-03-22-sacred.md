It is not the place itself that is sacred or special to someone, but rather what happens there how secret and sacred those events are. For example, a bedroom might hold significance for someone who is not married, but would it be sacred if nothing has happened or will happen there? Similarly, how sacred is what occurs in a house without the presence of those who have lived there or the memories tied to it?
