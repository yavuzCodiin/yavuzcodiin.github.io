It's been a little over a year since I quit smoking. As a result of the decision and determination I made, I now find the smell of cigarettes quite unpleasant and prefer not to be in such environments. I don’t crave cigarettes at all, and drinks like coffee don’t trigger any desire. As someone who used to smoke immediately upon waking up and even before breakfast, my stomach feels much better now. I’m happy that I made this decision, but I regret the approximately 11 years I spent smoking. However, I want to share with you a quote that I love: "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now." I planted this tree about a year ago, and I hope to enjoy its benefits in the coming years.
