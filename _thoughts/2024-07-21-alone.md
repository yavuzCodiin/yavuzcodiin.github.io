Aren't we all alone? We are born alone and we die alone. We eat alone, we travel alone, we cry alone and we find happiness alone. Loneliness can be both a need and a necessity. Loneliness is usually reserved for God and we seek ways to overcome it. Sometimes someone like us comes along and fills the void; sometimes we find ourselves looking for a friend to ease the loneliness. Your loneliness may be accompanied by a friend, family or childhood friend, sometimes they leave you alone. Sometimes you walk alone on the road to success, face difficulties alone and feel lonely even in the midst of a crowd. After all, true loneliness is not the absence of people, but the absence of those who understand us.
