Playing games is more than just a hobby for me; it's a passion that goes beyond mere entertainment. It's an escape, a challenge, and sometimes even a way to connect with others. Gaming allows me to immerse myself in new worlds, solve complex problems, and experience stories in a way no other medium can offer. It's not just about passing time; it's about the thrill of competition, the joy of exploration, and the satisfaction of achieving something meaningful. For me, gaming is a blend of creativity, strategy, and emotion—a true part of who I am. I always wanted a PlayStation as a child, but I couldn’t get one until the PS4 was released. Before that, I had chances to play on the PS1, PS2, and PS3 at friends’ houses, in internet cafes, and other places. Still, I never owned one for a long time. Now, 30 years later, PlayStation announced its 30th Anniversary. I really wanted to get the special edition DualSense controller for myself. However, after waiting for a while, I couldn’t find one and eventually forgot about it—until last week when I saw it and finally got it. It looks incredible, and the way you can feel the action through it is truly amazing.
