(Movie Name: Spirited Away) I've known Spirited Away for quite some time, and I really enjoy Hayao Miyazaki's films. He and Studio Ghibli have created movies that I can watch over and over again, and Spirited Away is one of my favorites. What I especially love about Spirited Away is the character No-Face, the impact of love, the enchanting environment, and the uniqueness of nearly every character. I don't see repetition; I see the hard work and passion that went into making this film. The movie begins with the characters entering a tunnel that leads to a ghost town, which later fills with souls as our adventure starts. Throughout the journey, we encounter numerous challenges, but we always find solutions. Along the way, we've showed that we are not greed, we've contented with what we've been given, and we've consistently acted with benevolence. Through these experiences, we've discovered and seen so much more. The film is a visual feast in itself, a peaceful world has been created, it supports it with beautiful music and I enjoyed it very much as it progresses fluently, I recommend it.
