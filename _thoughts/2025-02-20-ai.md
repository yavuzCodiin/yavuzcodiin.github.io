I’ve been experimenting with and testing AI for a long time. Since the early days when it became available to consumers, I’ve been trying to integrate it into my life. I’m not limited to a single AI I’ve spent time testing various models, including smaller ones locally. From ChatGPT to Perplexity, I’ve tried almost all of them: DeepSeek, Gemini, Claude, and more. At different times, they outperform each other or specialize in specific areas. For instance, I use Gemini for deep research, Claude for coding, and Perplexity for browsing the internet. If I could find one AI that handles all these tasks at a decent level it doesn’t have to be the best I’d prefer it. I don’t think it’s ideal to rely on too many different tools.
