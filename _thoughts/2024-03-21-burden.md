Sometimes I recall memories in great detail, perhaps triggered by music, food, or smell. However, at other times, I struggle to remember even simple things like what I ate for breakfast. Recently, I remembered my great-grandmother and the wonderful times spent at her house during family gatherings and holidays. As my dear elders have passed away, I realized how precious those memories truly were. It is a great burden to be aware that those times are past, and sometimes it is hard to let go of the past. However, Victor Frankl's case study helped me to offload this burden. Let me share it with you too. An elderly doctor fell into depression two years after his wife's passing. Instead of analyzing the situation, Frankl posed a thought-provoking question: What if the doctor had died first? The man realized that his wife would have endured immense suffering from such a loss. Frankl revealed that by surviving, he spared his wife from agony. His grief gave his suffering profound meaning and purpose. Therefore, the price I am paying is grief.
