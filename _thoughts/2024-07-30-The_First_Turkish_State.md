Today, when asked about the first Turkish state, I paused. Several possibilities came to mind, but I couldn't definitively say which one it was. I often question how well someone can understand their future if they don't know their past, and this was one of those moments for me. I started my search and discovered that the first Turkish state was the Great Hun Empire / Asian Hun Empire. Its capital was Ötüken, its first known ruler was Teoman, and its most significant ruler was Mete. During that period, it was a confederation of nomadic tribes flourishing on the steppes. They were strong and warrior-like, but they had a relatively weak culture at that time. However, they possessed highly advanced martial skills, particularly in archery and horseback riding.
