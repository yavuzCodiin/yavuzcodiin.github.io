If there is a problem, you can do two things: you can either solve the problem at its root or you can manage it/control it. The first is relatively more difficult but leads to more lasting results. The second one may take you a short or long time, but it will eventually break out. Therefore, in my opinion, the time spent for the first one will be a more correct/better way.
