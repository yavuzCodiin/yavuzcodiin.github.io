After much planning, I’ve finally upgraded my room setup! I now have a height-adjustable desk, a bookshelf for my figures and Legos, and another bookshelf with glass doors for my books to keep them dust-free and stylish. I carefully chose a Baroque/wood-like color scheme, which gives the space a much better overall look. Currently, I’m using two monitors, but in the future, I’m considering upgrading to a larger display, like the Odyssey Neo G9 (49" or 57"). I think such a monitor would fit the setup perfectly.
