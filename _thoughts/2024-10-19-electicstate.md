I first discovered Simon Stalenhag around 2019-2020. His unique style immediately caught my attention, and I began following his work with admiration. Recently, learned that a film inspired by his artwork will be released soon, which made me even more excited. While I was checking this, I also came across Tales from Loop, a series based on another of his works, and it looks good.
