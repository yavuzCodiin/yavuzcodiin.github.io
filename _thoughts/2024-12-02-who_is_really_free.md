title: "Who is really free?"

A thought visits me often: are we really free? Sometimes, yes. Sometimes, no. If we have all the money but no time, are we truly free? If we live in a place that doesn’t feel like home, that doesn’t embrace us, is that freedom?
We are free when we are with our loved ones, when we laugh, when we travel without limits. Yes, freedom has its cost, but it doesn’t have to be your entire life! True freedom is working where you love, doing what you’re passionate about, and surrounding yourself with good people. That’s when you’re truly free.
