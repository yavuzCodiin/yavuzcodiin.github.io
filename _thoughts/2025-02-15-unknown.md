<img src="/images/visual_thoughts/creator_icon.png" alt="creator_icon" style="width:25px; height:25px; vertical-align:middle;"> Those who create something for the first time, find it for the first time or build a system are the ones who have the most difficulty, but there is no need to reinvent the wheel, but we can make better things by using it, shaping it according to our needs
<img src="/images/visual_thoughts/creator_icon.png" alt="creator_icon" style="width:25px; height:25px; vertical-align:middle;"> Spotify > Apple Music: I used youtube music for a while via youtube premium, but at some point I realized that I didn't want to pay for youtube, so I canceled the subscription, I had either apple music or spotify, apple music gave me a 3-month free trial, but its usage interface, opening and closing files, etc. such features were extremely tiring when it should have been simple, and I went back to spotify after a long break and I am very happy with this decision, whether it is the podcasts I listen to, the ease of creating playlists, ai recommendation is very good.
