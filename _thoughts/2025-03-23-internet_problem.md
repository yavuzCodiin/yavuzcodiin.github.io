I have been having problems with my internet for a long time, I was forced to use 8 Mbps Adsl due to my location and I could not even request to switch to fibre, so I switched to hypernet, they gave 24 Mbps, but since my room was too far from the modem, I was getting 5-6 Mbps, let alone 24 Mbps, I researched the reason a lot and found the solution in setting up an external mesh network inside the house and after setting it up, I went up to about 21-22 Mbps, the technology is really very good, this is the exact same product I shared in the picture, I recommend Mercusys, a sub-brand of TP-Link company specialised in this field.
