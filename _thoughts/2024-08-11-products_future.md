<p class="colored-text_1">I have been thinking about this for some time, people are trying to develop products that looks so sci-fi/futuristic but the problem is their hardware ai capabilities etc. are not alone well or enough but they are showing like that. Like in the humane ai pin they showed it like revolutionary ai device but in the and a phone can do or I saw ai friend which is ai necklace but problem is you need bluetooth connection to your phone which is a phone can handle most of the things because we are carrying it to everywhere or there is rabbit ai companion device it is also not making my life easier comparing with mobile phone, so I think we are not there yet.</p>
