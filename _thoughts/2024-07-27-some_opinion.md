If a country's land is rich, brimming with wealth, serving as a bridge between Asia and Europe, and its people are hardworking, determined, and intelligent, yet it remains in such a dire state, the greatest blame lies with its leaders, their incompetence and the people who can't change this incompetent. If the people have no say in governance and both the ruling party and the opposition are equally ineffective, even the most beautiful utopias are destined to become dystopias.
