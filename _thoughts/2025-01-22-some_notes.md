<img src="/images/visual_thoughts/tght_icon.png" alt="thought_icon" style="width:32px; height:32px; vertical-align:middle;"> Today I bought a lunch box, I have wanted this for a long time because I did not want to eat unhealthy or the same things all the time, now I can take food from home.

<img src="/images/visual_thoughts/tght_icon.png" alt="thought_icon" style="width:32px; height:32px; vertical-align:middle;">today I listened to a podcast by a former prime minister of Canada and I didn't get some of his good words/advice;
    Be on the job when luck passes, luck prefers to be prepared
    Sleep on big choices
    Honesty > short-term gains. Stand behind decisions in line with your principles
    Not everyone will like you. Focus on what matters and don't waste your energy on naysayers, 
    Self-confidence comes from self-acceptance, not universal approval
