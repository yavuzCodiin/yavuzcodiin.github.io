The unknown frightens and excites us at the same time. If we knew with certainty that something we desire or fear would happen at a certain time or date, would we feel the same nervousness or happiness that we feel today? I have always been an impatient person, and although I still believe I am to some extent, I think I have made significant progress in this regard. Whether it is the impatience I feel when waiting for a phone call, when solving a problem, when looking forward to socialising again, or when pursuing a goal or a dream, there are times when I am extremely nervous. This stress exacerbates the problems caused by my nervousness and I make great efforts to overcome it. Maybe it's not for nothing that they say, "The patient dervish has reached his goal."
