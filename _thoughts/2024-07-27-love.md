Do we truly love life itself, or is it the places, animals, people, memories, food, literature, and music that we cherish? I believe it's the emotions and feelings we associate with these experiences that define our love for life. It's not my university I miss, but the people I met, the time I spent there, and the emotions I felt. Ultimately, it seems that emotions are the essence of life itself.
