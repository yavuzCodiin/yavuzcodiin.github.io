Hello there I'm Yavuz ERTUÄžRUL, I graduated from METU (#1 in Turkey, #133 in World, QS World 2024 University Rankings in Electrical and Electronics Engineering). My passion for software development strengthened during my university years, increasing my desire to pursue a career in this field. In this direction, I participated in Microsoft's Microsoft Student Partner program in 2016-2017, where I worked on future technologies like Chatbot, Azure, and Cognitive Services. In 2017, I interned at Microsoft in the Developer Experiences & Evangelism department. During this period, I reinforced my knowledge in software and technology through concrete projects.

My interest in robotics and software engineering deepened with two separate internships. In my first internship, I worked on computer-based autonomous driving algorithms. In my second internship, I gained experience in image processing and robotic arms related to actual robotic products. Afterwards, I worked as a Robotic Application Engineer for about 9 months at the company where I interned, being responsible for the company's first R&D product and contributing significantly to its development. I am currently working as Robotics Software Engineer @ NH Tech Robotics.

With my quick learning ability and intense research motivation, I am eager to succeed in this industry. Additionally, I am working on projects involving the Python programming language and various Machine Learning technologies. I continuously write articles on programming and new technologies on the Medium platform, and I decided to archive my learning journey through this blog.
